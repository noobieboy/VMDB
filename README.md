# 🛡️ VMDB - Vulnerability Management Database

**VMDB** is a structured, name-wise vulnerability knowledge base created to document and manage security issues efficiently. This repository helps penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and security teams to store and share detailed writeups of vulnerabilities in a standardized format.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of VMDB is to create a central reference library that contains real-world vulnerabilities with detailed context, reproducible proof-of-concept (PoC), business impact, and proper remediation guidance — useful for:

- Knowledge sharing across security teams
- Report writing references
- Vulnerability trending analysis
- Bug bounty and VAPT preparation
- Training and onboarding

## 📁 Structure

Each vulnerability is saved as an individual Markdown (`.md`) file inside the repo, using the following template:
